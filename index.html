        <p>Hello! My name is Brandon Adolf. I am a father to the cutest (unbiased opinion) toddler out there. 
            Currently I am living life through working a full time job, doing Pathway Worldwide and hanging 
            out with my son during all the other moments. I also enjoy reading and woodworking as hobbies I am 
            trying to convert my son towards.</p>
