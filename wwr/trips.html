<!-- Create an trips.html in the wwr directory that contains the same header, navigation, and footer as the other pages on the site. (Hint: copy and paste like you did for the Contact Us page.)
Prep the new page by changing the title and meta description in the head section. Remove the non-relevant content within the main element.
The following components are required on the Trips page:
1 Call to action to contact the company. This action opens the Contact Us page on the site.
2 At least three detailed trip descriptions with photos.
3 A table outlining all the available trips with relevant information.
4 For full credit consideration, you cannot just have a simple, single column flow layout.
5 Create a wireframe design sketch of the Trips page layout and content. Be sure that you include the required components, described above, in your layout. Save the wireframe as an image in your wwr images folder. -->
